‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for any unauthorized or malicious activity. Always use this tool responsibly and only on wallets you own or have been granted explicit access to.

## How It Works

WalletGen uses established standards like [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin wallet creation, and [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-based blockchains.

The software compares generated addresses against known address databases or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers.

WalletGen is open-source and built in C++, allowing for high performance and modifications. It offers considerably faster wallet generation speeds than Python-based options. Performance is primarily dictated by your CPU & GPU.

## Why Choose WalletGen for Professional Bitcoin Recovery?

Why choose slower methods? **WalletGen**, written in C++, offers up to **10x faster** recovery than alternatives. If you are looking to recover lost wallets, this tool offers secure, efficient, and powerful methods for recovering Bitcoin.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** uses brute-force techniques for checking Bitcoin wallet balances.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   Press `3` or run `start_search_btc.bat` for internet searching.
*   Press `6` for the database search.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` for an internet search.
*   Press key `6` to use the database.

### Speed Considerations:

*   Your hardware, especially your GPU, impacts the search speed. Running multiple instances (1 to 4) can improve results.

Databases increase the search efficiency.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When WalletGen finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search will **Stop** immediately.
*   The wallet details are **Displayed** in the console.
*   The data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** into a compatible crypto wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  You can transfer the funds.

>  Consider donating a portion of the recovered balance!

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen can recover Bitcoin wallets using seed phrases. You can enter the full phrase or use wildcards.

### Process Description

#### Search for Missing Words:

Use * for missing words. WalletGen checks all combinations.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed. WalletGen generates and checks balances.
